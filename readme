In This Release
===============

This file describes the Linux* Base Driver for the Atheros(R) AR8131/AR8151/
AR8152/AR8161 PCI-E Ethernet Adapter, version 1.0.0.0 This driver supports 
2.6.x kernels.

This driver is only supported as a loadable module at this time. Atheros is not 
supplying patches against the kernel source to allow for static linking of 
the driver. For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the 
documentation supplied with your Atheros(R) adapter. All hardware 
requirements listed apply to use with Linux.

Building and Installation
=========================

To build a binary RPM* package of this driver, run 'rpmbuild -tb 
<filename.tar.gz>'. Replace <filename.tar.gz> with the specific filename of 
the driver.

NOTE: For the build to work properly, the currently running kernel MUST match 
      the version and configuration of the installed kernel sources. If you 
      have just recompiled the kernel reboot the system now.

      RPM functionality has only been tested in Red Hat distributions.

1. Move the base driver tar file to the directory of your choice. For example,
   use /home/username/alx or /usr/local/src/alx.

2. Untar/unzip archive:

     tar zxf alx-x.x.x.x.tar.gz

3. Change to the driver src directory:

     cd alx-x.x.x.x/src/

4. Compile the driver module:

     make install

   The binary will be installed as:

     /lib/modules/<KERNEL VERSION>/kernel/drivers/net/alx.[k]o

   The install locations listed above are the default locations. They might 
   not be correct for certain Linux distributions. For more information, 
   see the ldistrib.txt file included in the driver tar.

5. Install the module:

     insmod alx <parameter>=<value>

6. Assign an IP address to the interface by entering the following, where
   x is the interface number:

     ifconfig ethx <IP_address>

7. Verify that the interface works. Enter the following, where <IP_address>
   is the IP address for another machine on the same subnet as the interface 
   that is being tested:

     ping  <IP_address> 

Command Line Parameters
=======================

If the driver is built as a module, the  following optional parameters are 
used by entering them on the command line with the modprobe or insmod command
using this syntax:

     modprobe alx [<option>=<VAL1>,<VAL2>,...]

     insmod alx [<option>=<VAL1>,<VAL2>,...] 

For example, with two L001 PCIE adapters, entering:

     insmod alx TxMemSize=80,128
loads the alx driver with 8KB TX memory for the first adapter and 10KB TX memory 
for the second adapter.

The default value for each parameter is generally the recommended setting,
unless otherwise noted.

    NOTES: A descriptor describes a data buffer and attributes related to the 
           data buffer. This information is accessed by the hardware.

media_type
Valid Range: 0-4
	0    - auto-negotiate at all supported speeds
	1    - only link at 1000Mbps Full Duplex
	2    - only link at 100Mbps Full Duplex
	3    - only link at 100Mbps Half Duplex
	4    - only link at 10Mbps Full Duplex
	5    - only link at 10Mbps Half Duplex
Default Value: 0
    media_type forces the line speed/duplex to the specified value in 
    megabits per second(Mbps). If this parameter is not specified or is set 
    to 0 and the link partner is set to auto-negotiate, the board will 
    auto-detect the correct speed. 

int_mod_timer
Valid Range: 50-65000
Default Value: 100
    This value represents the minmum interval between interrupts controller 
    generated. 

RxMemBlock
Valid Range: 16-512 
Default Value: 64
    This value is the number of receice memory block allocated by the driver. 
    Increasing this value allows the driver to buffer more incoming packets. 
    Each memory block is 1536 bytes.

    NOTE: Depending on the available system resources, the request for a
    higher number of receive descriptors may be denied.  In this case,
    use a lower number.

TxMemSize
Valid Range: 4-64
Default Value: 8
    This value is the number KB of transmit memory allocated by the driver. 
    Increasing this value allows the driver to queue more transmits.

    NOTE: Depending on the available system resources, the request for a
    higher number of transmit descriptors may be denied.  In this case,
    use a lower number.
    

Additional Configurations
=========================

  Configuring the Driver on Different Distributions
  -------------------------------------------------

  Configuring a network driver to load properly when the system is started is
  distribution dependent. Typically, the configuration process involves adding
  an alias line to /etc/modules.conf as well as editing other system startup 
  scripts and/or configuration files. Many popular Linux distributions ship 
  with tools to make these changes for you. To learn the proper way to 
  configure a network device for your system, refer to your distribution 
  documentation. If during this process you are asked for the driver or module 
  name, the name for the Linux Base Driver for the Atheros AR8131/AR8151/AR8152/
  AR8161 is alx
  
  As an example, if you install the alx driver for two AR8131/AR8151/AR8152/
  AR8161 adapters (eth0 and eth1) and set the speed and duplex to 10full and 
  100half, add the following to modules.conf:

       alias eth0 alx
       alias eth1 alx
       options alx Speed=10,100 Duplex=2,1

  Viewing Link Messages
  ---------------------

  Link messages will not be displayed to the console if the distribution is 
  restricting system messages. In order to see network driver link messages 
  on your console, set dmesg to eight by entering the following:

       dmesg -n 8

  NOTE: This setting is not saved across reboots.


Known Issues
============

NOTE: For distribution-specific information, see the ldistrib.txt file 
      included in the driver tar.

  Driver Compilation
  ------------------

  When trying to compile the driver by running make install, the following
  error may occur: 

      "Linux kernel source not configured - missing version.h"

  To solve this issue, create the version.h file by going to the Linux source 
  tree and entering:

      make include/linux/version.h.
